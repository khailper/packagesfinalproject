\description{
This function takes a year (in the form of a string or number) and returns a filename for a csv.bs2 file containing accident data for that year.
Note that the function does not return the file, just a string that can be passed to a write function. While the function retruns errors if the input is
the wrong type, is doesn't check to see if the input is a four-digit year.  make_filename is not dependant on any functions other than ones in base R.
